# dco-citations
Generate formatted publication citation from DCO ID.

A start will be having a serving that when user enters in the address bar, for instance, "`http://dx.deepcarbon.net/11121/2803-7494-8579-1947-CC?citation=PNAS`", the webpage then will show the user the citation generated in PNAS format for the corresponding publication.


This may be just one suggestion on how this will work.
